# XML-RPC-Exploiting
![alt-text] (https://github.com/FabianOnSecurity/XML-RPC-Exploiting/blob/main/images/xml_rpc-image.jpg)
Exploiting XML-RPC.php in common Wordpress Applications.

This tool is a classic password bruteforcer, that uses Post-Requests on /xmlrpc.php.
Can bypass:
- /wp-admin protection
- fail2ban default protection
- actual IONOS default config

This tool is actually not multi-threaded.

## Syntax

```
xml_rpc_bruteforce.py url <e.g. http://$host:8080/> wordlist <e.g. /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt> user <e.g. admin>
```
For User Enumeration use the tool WP-SCAN.
