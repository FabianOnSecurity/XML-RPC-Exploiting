# XML-RPC-Exploiting
Exploiting XML-RPC.php in common Wordpress Applications.

This tool is a classic password bruteforcer, that uses Post-Requests on /xmlrpc.php.
Can bypass:
- /wp-admin protection
- fail2ban default protection
- actual IONOS default config

This tool is actually not multi-threaded.
